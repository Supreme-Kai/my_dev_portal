        My Dev Portal is an open source project and we are always looking for contributors.
        If there is a template or a feature that we don't have then contribute it!
        Either build it yourself or submit the design, or desired feature, under
        = link_to 'Issues', 'https://github.com/SWLivingstone/my_dev_portal/issues'
        and someone will build it for you.

          My Dev Portal exists as both an opportunity and a tool.  It is an
          opportunity for new and experienced developers to contribute to a
          growing open source project.  It is a tool for developers to build and
          host their portfolio, track their job applications, and keep a developer blog.
